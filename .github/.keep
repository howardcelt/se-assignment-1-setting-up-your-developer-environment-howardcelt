bashCopy code
python --version
If Python is installed, it will display the version number (e.g., Python 3.9.1). If it's not installed.

Step 6: Verify the Installation
Once the installation is complete, open your command prompt or terminal again and run:
bashCopy code
python --version
You should see the installed Python version.

Step 7: Install a Code Editor (Optional)
While Python includes the IDLE development environment, many developers prefer using code editors like Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or Jupyter Notebook for a more robust coding experience. Download and install a code editor of your choice.

Step 8: Write Your First Python Code
Open your code editor and create a new Python file with the ".py" extension. For example, "hello.py."
pythonCopy code
print("Hello, World!")
